## PROJECTS

## EXPERIENCE
**Machine Learning Engineer**
Transport Canada, 2023
- Collaborated with a team using Azure DevOps and Kanban to implement a machine learning framework, improving the efficiency of updates for the Government of Canada's regulatory catalog.
- Achieved 95% accuracy in classifying over 200,000 regulatory data points using a fine-tuned BERT model, enhancing quick access to regulation types for regulators.
- Developed a LangChain and LLM-based tool for quantifying administrative burdens, significantly reducing manual review time by automating burden calculations across departments.
- Managed Databricks pipelines for data transformation and integration of multilingual regulatory data, ensuring robust data processing workflows.
- Conducted regular knowledge-sharing sessions on machine learning and prompt-engineering techniques.

**Web Designer**
Unit Operations Laboratory, University of Toronto, 2019
- Developed a comprehensive multi-page WordPress website, incorporating interactive 360-degree videos to facilitate access to Standard Operating Procedures for approximately


## PROJECT
**Question Answering Machine, 2024**
- Finetuned a Transformers model for Q&A purposes based on the COVID-19 research dataset
- Generated Question-Answer pairs using a BART model and finetuned a distilbert model for extractive QuestionAnswering.

**Convolutional Neural Networks, 2023**
- Produced a Convolutional Neural Networks model using VGG16 to correctly identify front view of faces with an 80% accuracy, using a small data-set of handpicked images
- Modified a pre-trained CNN model's architecture by applying Deep Learning and Transfer Learning through adding Dense layers and evaluating the model through DropOut layers for Multi-class classification tasks
- Incorporated the model in a real-time video to experiment with the applicability of using the model through a camera
